# Stabilizer State Calculations

This Python program is designed to work with qudits, which are quantum systems in which the base state can be described by `d` levels.

Contained in this project is also Scott Aaronson's CHP and an attempt to modify it to be multithreaded and use AVX-512.

## Output

The output of this program using `SUPRESS_OUTPUT` and `LOG_OUTPUT` respectively includes:

- The total number of gates seen.
- A text file containing all the stabilized states.
