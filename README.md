# Stabilizer State Calculations

This Python program is designed to work with qudits, which are quantum systems in which the base state can be described by `d` levels.

## Output

The output of this program using `SUPRESS_OUTPUT` and `LOG_OUTPUT` respectively includes:

-   The total number of gates seen.
-   A text file containing all the stabilized states.
