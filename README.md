# Python Conjugation

This Python program is located in the Python folder. It is designed to work with qudits, which are quantum systems in which the base state can be described by `d` levels. It uses string conjugation (a very slow but intuitive method) to keep track of the Pauli's, opting away from direct modular arithmetic.

# CHP Modifications

Contained in the main directory of the project is also Scott Aaronson's CHP and an attempt to modify it to be multithreaded and use AVX-512.
`chp_multithread.c` uses OpenMP to speed it up and was shown to have positive scaling for large number of qubits (10,000) and negative for small number of qubits.
`chp_simd.cpp` uses Intel Intrinsics and AVX-512 to speed it up and was shown to have positive scaling for moderate number of qubits (1,000) and negative for large number of qubits.

## Code structure

`chp.c` and `chp_multithread.c` are monolithic and run with what is in those files.

`chp_simd.cpp` uses modern C++ convention and so splits it into `gates.h`, `gates.cpp`, `quantum.h`, `quantum.cpp`, and finally `tableau.h`, `tableau.cpp`.

## Profiling

This was done on the two circuits `rand.chp` and `rand2.chp, both generated by Scott Aaronson's included code `randqc.c`.

The binaries are not included but were compiled with the following g++ arguments

`g++ -o chp_simd chp_simd.cpp -O3 -mavx512f -mavx512bw`

`gcc -o chp_multithread chp_multithread.c -O3 -fopenmp`

`gcc -o chp chp.c -O3`
